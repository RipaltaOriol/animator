# Java Animator

For my final project in the Object-Oriented Design course at Northeastern University, I developed a Java animator. This project showcases and animates a range of shapes, culminating in the rendering of diverse moving structures. Additionally, I incorporated features such as the ability to resume or pause the animation, and to adjust its speed by increasing or decreasing it.
