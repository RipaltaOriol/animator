Assignment 8 was a very interesting and fun assignment. It gave me a lot of insight into how my own design works,
and about the different ways in which one can design this animation software. It was, to be honest, and great
and very convenient experience for us, since our code and our provider's code worked on the same concept.

Looking at our provider's code, we learnt that we could have used enum as a data type for storing multiple things,
such as shape type or the type of edit. This would have been a lot more flexible and less complicated than using
String fields.

We also learnt from their code, that we have a direct reference to an instance of our model in our EditView.
This gives the view the ability to directly mutate the model, which should be the job of the controller. We
made changes accordingly and now, our EditView does not have a direct reference to our model.

The providers assigned to us for Assignment 8 were:
** Timothy (tgiancola) Giancola (giancola.t@husky.neu.edu)
** Nithila Raman (raman.n@husky.neu.edu)

They were very willing and prompt while responding to our doubts and questions. Nithila very well
answered all of our questions, providing us with sufficient information to understand their code,
while also adhering to the assignment rules.

We were very fortunate to be given their code, since their design was kind of similar to ours, and hence
adapting their view to our model was not a hard task.
