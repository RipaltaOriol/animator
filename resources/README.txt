In our final submission, we can say that all features work.

Our View:
The text output, works just as mentioned in the assignment.
The svg output, when saved in an xml file and opened in a browser, displays
a smooth animation.
The visual view output, displays a smooth animation in a frame of the given
size, with the given speed.
The Edit View output, displays a smooth animation in a frame of the given
size, with the given speed once the user has clicked 'start'.
The user can:
Increase Speed
Decrease Speed
Pause animation
Resume animation
Loop the animation
Disable the loop
Edit the animation: delete shape
                    delete keyFrame
                    insert keyFrame
                    Modify keyFrame

Provider's Edit View:
The Edit View output, displays a smooth animation in a frame of the given
size, with the given speed. The provider's version of the edit view does not
have the 'start' feature, and hence we have not implemented it in our version.
The user can:
Increase Speed
Decrease Speed
Pause animation
Resume animation
Loop the animation
Disable the loop
Edit the animation: delete shape
                    add shape
                    set keyFrame
                    remove keyFrame
In an email Nithila mentioned that all functions for editing work except for remove shape. However,
we have fixed that feature in this version. We did not need to make any changes in their
View classes to make this feature work. She also mentioned, that the trick with adding
a shape is you have to add more than one key frame before it actually appears on the screen.
